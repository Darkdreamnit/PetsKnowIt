<p>Due to the fact that sausage is high in fat, it is the primary factor sausage is bad for dogs. What would you say if you found out that most sausages can consist of up to as much as half fat? This is never healthy for any type of pet, due to the fact that it will not only cause weight problems, it will likewise cause a great deal of other health concerns, consisting of heart issues such as, diabetes and pancreatitis. 
<p>You will find that sausage is usually filled with salt, spices and other flavorings that are bad for pets. These spices can consist of garlic and onions, which are both really bad for any pet, and can trigger red blood cell damage.</p>

<h2>Much Healthier Meat Options For Pets</h2>
Do not offer your pets those Vienna sausages you cooked for yourself. Rather, there are much healthier alternatives that dogs love that will not trigger weight problems or other heart issues when given in small amounts. There are sausage-like doggy treats you can give them that are made particularly for canines, this means that they are high in different types of nutrients.

                                                Yes, sausage is bad for dogs as it has high salt and fatty contents. Some sausages also have onion and garlic powder included. Onion and garlic powder are bad for dogs and should not be fed. Any dog that eats onions or 
                                                garlic is at risk of developing anemia. These ingredients alone should tell you all you need to know as to the question why is sausage bad for dogs.

                                            <h2>Diarrhea And Dehydration</h2><p>

                                                Sausage, as mentioned above, can trigger dogs to have the runs or throw up.
                                                
                                                If your pet gets ill from consuming sausage, you must take away food (for roughly 24 hours). That will give enough time to the stomach to settle.
                                                
                                                Be sure to supply lots of water while you feed some type of bland food for some time.

                                                The spiciness and richness of sausage, together with the high salty content, is an unsafe mix. This can quickly cause a seriously dehydrated pet.</p>

                                                Meaty Raw bones such as raw lamb ribs (however not lamb chops) and also raw lamb flaps offer a number of essential benefits to your dog's health such as keeping gums and teeth healthy.</p>
                                                <p>
                                                Bones should constantly be provided raw (raw). Never ever feed your canine prepared bones as these can splinter, triggering possibly deadly internal damage or digestive blockage.</[>
                                                <p>
                                                The bone should be big enough just so that the dog can not fit the entire bone in his/her mouth or swallow the whole bone. Prevent big marrow bones (these have extremely thick external rims), T-bones, 'slice' bones (e.g. lamb cutlets), bones sawn lengthwise (as done by some butchers) and big knuckle bones and as canines might split their teeth on these.</p>
                                                <p>
                                                When they are consuming bones, you need to constantly monitor your pet.
                                                
                                                Pets truly like bones and can in some cases end up being protective over them, so make sure to discourage young kids and others from approaching pet dogs whilst they eat it.</p>

<h2>So what are the different types of sausages?</h2>

                                                    Chicken sausage is usually healthier than pork sausage but, as always, check the nutrition information on any prepackaged product. Stats I tend to look for on the nutrition information of prepackaged sausages include: calories per gram, fat per gram (saturated and unsaturated), protein per gram, and anything else that stands out (e.g.: whether the sausage has an unusually high sodium content). If you want to get really serious about your sausage healthiness comparisons, you can make an Excel spreadsheet of your favourite brands, but I don’t recommend spending your weekend that way.

                                                    As with many foods, it’s all about ingredients and preparation.

                                                    <p>Pets are at times our best friends. We should all take care of them with everything we have. They depend on us for food 
                                                        and shelter and they in turn give us their love and attention. We love our dog Sage and could never see ourselves living without her.</p>
