                                                Garlic is a part of the Allium family which also includes chives, and onions. These are all poisonous to dogs but garlic is 5 times more dangerous than the others. Onion is more dangerous to cats and some types of Japanese dogs such as the 
                                                the Akita. Garlic has the potential to cause damage to the red blood cells. These red blood cells will rupture and lead to anemia in your dog. Some signs of anemia in your dog 
                                                are pale gums, lethargy, increased heart rate, intolerance to exercise.

                                                If your dog ever gets sick after eating sausage, the best thing to do would to try and find out how much sausage he/she has eaten. If it is more than you are comfortable with him/her eating, call a veterinarian.

                                                    Just like dogs, sausage is dangerous to cats if taken in large amounts. You must avoid feeding your cat sausage and take the necessary steps to get your cat well if somehow they ingest some.

                                                    Chicken sausage is usually healthier than pork sausage but, as always, check the nutrition information on any prepackaged product. Stats I tend to look for on the nutrition information of prepackaged sausages include: calories per gram, fat per gram (saturated and unsaturated), protein per gram, and anything else that stands out (e.g.: whether the sausage has an unusually high sodium content). If you want to get really serious about your sausage healthiness comparisons, you can make an Excel spreadsheet of your favourite brands, but I don’t recommend spending your weekend that way.

                                                    As with many foods, it’s all about ingredients and preparation.
                                                    
                                                    If you have the option of buying either from a butcher or meat counter such that it is not pre-packaged, the chicken sausage will usually be healthier.

                                                    Is sausage safe for dogs? No, not in large amounts. Tasting it will not cause harm, but eating it will. Feeding your dog sausage is a bad idea. 
                                                    Many other alternatives will keep your furry friend happy.
