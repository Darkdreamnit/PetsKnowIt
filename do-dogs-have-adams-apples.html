                                            <h1>Do Dogs Have Adam’s Apples?</h1>
                                        
                                            <p>Yes, all dogs do have an Adam's Apples. Specialists typically describe Adam's Apples in pets as the Larynx.</p>

<p>If you've ever before listened to someone claiming that dogs don't have Adam's apples yet describe a swelling that is located in the front of the neck as the Larynx, you must not stress. That's the Adam's apple!</p>

<p>However it is necessary to keep in mind that little swellings can be located in various places in your furry friend's body. This means that not all lumps you feel in your dog's body might not be an adam's apple and might just be some type of tumor.</p>

<h2>How do you find your dog's adam's apple?</h2>
<p>
    You can easily find the Adam's apple on your dog's throat. Just by using your thumb and forefinger, you can feel around to make sure 
    that there are no unusual swellings around the area. Even if it's an Adam's apple or not, it is always best to inspect it anyhow to understand what's going on.
</p>
<p>
    Move your fingers from the front of the neck that is located below the chin. Do not use excessive force on your dog's throat. Your dog will be uneasy for a little while, 
    and it might make them cough. After doing this, you should feel the firm and sometimes huge cartilage. This cartilage you are feeling is the Adam's apple.
</p>
<h2>How does a dog's trachea or larynx look?</h2>
<img src="images/adamsapples/dog_larynx_and_trachea.JPG" alt="dog's trachea and larynx"
<p>
    A dog's larynx and trachea are much like humans.
</p>
<h2>Do all dogs have Adam's apples?</h2>
<p>
    Every single dog you know have an Adam's apple. All pets have it, both females and males. You probably notice
     a small swelling on your dog's throat, no need to worry considering that it's typical for all dogs to have an Adam's apple.
</p>
<h2>Do female dogs have an adam's apple?</h2>
<p>
    Every human, yes, even ladies, will be born with an Adam's apple. Most pets undoubtedly have an Adam's apple; it is simply not 
    always easily seen though. Among men, the laryngeal prestige can be very visible. Nevertheless, amongst females or women, 
    it's easy to fall under the umbrella of people who think that they do not have one because you won't always be able to see it. Men are known to have way more bones in their necks than females, 
    and during adolescence, the neck expands in such a way that protects much longer vocal cords; for this reason men generally having much deeper voices than ladies.
</p>
<h2>Can you feel a dog's Adam's apple?</h2>
<p>
Yes you can feel a dog's adam's apple. It is known as the larynx and will sometimes protrude enough to be noticeable. 
</p>
<h2>But is it an Adam’s Apple Or Lump?</h2>
<p>
    If you notice a swelling on your dog's throat, you will be required to test if it is just their Adam's apple given that some dogs may develop swellings or growths on their throats. Nevertheless, it is known that some dogs develop bumps in the throat area.

It's recommended to get in touch with a vet as soon as possible if you observe any type of abnormalities on your dog's throat. If you believe it is more than an Adam's apple, the condition will 
certainly need to be treated immediately. It's much better to seek advice from the veterinarian if you are unsure about anything that has to do with any pet you have.
</p>
<h2>Do other animals have Adam's Apples?</h2>
<p>
    Some animals are known to have something called a laryngeal prominence, or an Adam's apple. Generally in animals with a sex-related dimorphism,
     where the male species have a considerable distinction in shape. Particularly in species where the males have deeper calls than the females.
</p>
<h2>What are the benefits of the SAdam's Apple?</h2>
<p>
    An adam's apple isn't just there for good looks. It serves a purpose in protecting the frontal portion and the walls of the larynx. With that being said, now you know that the adam's apple plays a major role in keeping 
    us safe.

                                               <h4>Do Dogs Have Adams Apples?</h4>
                                               Yes, dogs do have an Adam's apple. You shouldn't be too alarmed to see a dog's adam's apple. However, if the lump is looking different than it used to be, then contact your veterinarian 
                                               and maybe show him/her over a video call. 
                                            </p>
