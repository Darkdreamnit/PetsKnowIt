                                                Your dog might sound like he/she has a stuffy nose because of a couple different reasons. The main reason might be a condition called Reverse Sneezing. Reverse Sneezing is where your dog makes repeated snorting noises that sound like he/she has a blocked nasal passageway. This is caused by irritation of the palate/laryngeal area. You will know your dog is experiencing 
                                                Reverse Sneezing if you see him/her

                                                Whenever the mucous membranes become inflamed, they usually cause swelling, and when swelling occurs, breathing becomes difficult.

                                                To treat rhinitis in cats, firstly, a veterinarian has to figure out what the underlying cause of the illness is. This will ultimately tell the veterinarian the steps he/she needs to take to treat the rhinitis.

                                            Yes. Much like colds in humans, cat cold can go away too. Cat colds take anywhere between -2 weeks to clear up on its own. However, if there does not seem to be any health improvement by the start of the fourth day, 
                                            a veterinarian must be contacted.

                                                It is always good to offer warmed up cat food as this encourages the intake of needed nutrients into the body. Remove any discharge from their nose by wiping with a damp, clean cloth. Maybe the most important thing to do is to always make sure there is always enough drinking water available.
