                                                Diarrhea is defined as a loose or watery stool that happens more frequently than it usually does. Watch to see if the stool continues for more than one time being watery. 
                                            </p>

                                                If diarrhea in your dog is mild and does not seem to be of an immediate emergency, then treating your dog's diarrhea by switching his/her diet will help clear up the symptoms easily. Feed your dog these foods to help with diarrhea.

                                                    <li>White Rice</li>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Giving your dog human food isn't always the best idea. But when it comes down to helping your furry friend with diarrhea, white rice is should be your number one go-to food. White rice is good for your dog's stomach as it is one type of food that is very easy to digest and it is very low in fiber. Fiber helps humans and animals pass stools easier and that would not help with diarrhea.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <h3>How much rice to feed dog with diarrhea</h3>
                                                    <p>
                                                        The amount of rice you would feed your dog during diarrhea will be dependent on what you usually feed during meal time. If you usually feed your dog one cup of dog food, then feed your dog one cup of 
                                                        white rice. To spice things up for your dog, you could also substitute 1/3 of the rice with with boiled chicken mixed-in.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <li>Rice Water</li>
                                                    <p>
                                                        After boiling some rice, before letting it fully cook, you can drain the water and let it cool before giving it to your dog. Rice water provides needed electrolytes for your dog.

                                                    <p>
                                                        Feeding your dog boiled mashed potatoes when they have diarrhea is good because it provides needs vitamins and minerals to keep your dog healthy. Mashed boiled potatoes provide your dogs with Vitamin B6, Vitamin C, magnesium, 
                                                        potassium, and fiber. However, you should only feed your dog this type of food during diarrhea or only occasionally as it is high in starch and sugar. Sugar and starch are the perfect combinations to start too much weight gain.

                                                        Oatmeal contains a fiber known as soluble fiber. Soluble fiber helps to slow gastric emptying and also helps with controlling diarrhea. This type of fiber is also very helpful to older dogs with irregular bowel movement issues.

                                                        syndrome, and gastritis. If you feed this herb to your dog, it will help to soothe your dog's gut.

                                                The most common cause of diarrhea in dogs is due to a virus they picked up somewhere. Places dogs can get viruses from are from drinking water from the ground outside if they become thirsty and there is not any water in their water bowl.

                                            Simply changing your dog's diet can cause his/her bowel movement to change in texture. It takes 1 to 3 days for your dogs stomach to get used to the different amounts of proteins and minerals within the 
                                            new food.

                                                The simplest home remedies you can give your dog for diarrhea are white rice, white rice water, and canned pumpkin. These home remedies will help clear up mild diarrhea in most dogs.

                                                 You should never starve your dog. You should only put your dog on a 12-24 Hour fast. This will give your dog's digestive system enough time to heal and rest. Remember, fasting is only for dogs and not puppies.

                                                Dogs can ingest medicine just like us humans do. One medicine in particular is Imodium (Loperamide).

                                            <p>
                                                The time to get concerned about your dog's diarrhea is whenever you confirm that the symptom is getting worse over 1-3 days continually.

                                                The first thing to do when your dog has diarrhea but acts fine is to see if a diet change helps.

                                                The first good advice i would give to anyone in this position is to not panic. Diarrhea in dogs does not mean that the world is coming to an end. Watch your dog for a day or two to see if the condition changes for better or worst. If it changes for better, then feed him/her the foods listed above. If however, the condition changes for the worse, then you need to contact a veterinarian.

                                                     <p>
                                                         Its always best to know how long diarrhea in dogs last as this will give you an idea of whether or not the condition is more serious than you think. Diarrhea in dogs usually 
                                                         last between 2 and 4 days. Any more than 4 days and i would suggest visiting a veterinarian. But withing the first to third day, try to feed your dog the different types of foods listed above.
                                                         
                                                     </p>
                                                     
                                                     <h3>What if my dog is getting diarrhea every few weeks</h3>
                                                     <p>
                                                         If your dog keeps on getting diarrhea every couple weeks, then, this means that the underlying cause of the diarrhea isn't being taken care of. Your dog could possibly be consuming water from a contaminated source, or
