                                                <p>Some felines are so afraid that they appear to live in a near-constant state of stress and anxiety, or they might reroute

                                                        <p>In some cases a distressing experience such as taking him or her to the vet or bringing a brand-new animal into the
                                                             house can interrupt his or her regular routine. If this happens you might see your cat hiding under the bed or table.</p>

                                                    Cats are afraid of cucumbers because they think of them as snakes. Most cats have never seen a snake before, however, their natural instincts kick in and tell them that the cucumber is dangerous.
