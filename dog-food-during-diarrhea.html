                                                Diarrhea is defined as a loose or watery stool that happens more frequently than it usually does. Watch to see if the stool continues for more than one time being watery. 
                                            </p>

                                            <p>
                                                The most common cause of diarrhea in dogs is due to a virus they picked up somewhere. Places dogs can get viruses from are from drinking water from the ground outside if they become thirsty and there is not any water in their water bowl.
                                            </p>

                                                If diarrhea in your dog is mild and does not seem to be of an immediate emergency, then treating your dog's diarrhea by switching his/her diet will help clear up the symptoms easily. Feed your dog these foods to help with diarrhea.

                                                        Giving your dog human food isn't always the best idea. But when it comes down to helping your furry friend with diarrhea, white rice is should be your number one go-to food. White rice is good for your dog's stomach as it is one type of food that is very easy to digest and it is very low in fiber. Fiber helps humans and animals pass stools easier and that would not help with diarrhea.

                                                    <p>
                                                        Feeding your dog boiled mashed potatoes when they have diarrhea is good because it provides needs vitamins and minerals to keep your dog healthy. Mashed boiled potatoes provide your dogs with Vitamin B6, Vitamin C, magnesium, 
                                                        potassium, and fiber. However, you should only feed your dog this type of food during diarrhea or only occasionally as it is high in starch and sugar. Sugar and starch are the perfect combinations to start too much weight gain.

                                                        Oatmeal contains a fiber known as soluble fiber. Soluble fiber helps to slow gastric emptying and also helps with controlling diarrhea. This type of fiber is also very helpful to older dogs with irregular bowel movement issues.

                                                The simplest home remedies you can give your dog for diarrhea are white rice, white rice water, and canned pumpkin. These home remedies will help clear up mild diarrhea in most dogs.

                                                This is never a wise choice, so no. Starving your dog is never the best thing to do in a situation like this. When your dog has diarrhea, he/she loses important nutrients and these nutrients will need to be replenished by the intake of food and fluids.

                                                The time to get concerned about your dog's diarrhea is whenever you confirm that the symptom is getting worse over 1-3 days continually.

                                                The first thing to do when your dog has diarrhea but acts fine is to see if a diet change helps.

                                            <p>
                                                The first good advice i would give to anyone in this position is to not panic. Diarrhea in dogs does not mean that the world is coming to an end. Watch your dog for a day or two to see if the condition changes for better or worst. If it changes for better, then feed him/her the foods listed above. If however, the condition changes for the worse, then you need to contact a veterinarian.
