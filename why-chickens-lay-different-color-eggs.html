                                            <h1>Why do chickens lay different colored eggs?</h1>

<p>

According to a study done by the Michigan State University Extension, the color of an egg is determined by the hen's genes. 
Different breeds of chicken will definitely show what shade eggs she will lay. 
For example, the breed of chicken known as the Leghorn lay white eggs while the breed Orpington lay brown eggs, and the Ameraucana create blue eggs. There is a breed of chickens knwon as the Olive Egger. These Olive Eggers 
lay olive green eggs. They were bred from the cross between a rooster and hen who had genes of a brown egg layer and a blue egg layer.
</p>

<h2>How eggshells get their color?</h2>
<p>

Every single egg start out as a shade of white; those that get laid in other colors apart from white get their color from pigments they attract while they were passing through a hen's oviduct. 
An egg takes 26 hours to pass through a hen's ovuduct. The shell however takes about 20 hours to fully develop.</p>
</p>
<p>
Hens that lay brown colored eggs transfer the pigment known as protoporphyrin on the eggs late in the process of developing the eggshell. For that reason, the pigment does not pass through the interior of the egg and only the surface of the egg. This is why brown eggs are white on the inside. The chickens known as Ameraucana gets the 
pigment known as oocyanin treansferred onto the egg while it passes through the oviduct. The oocyanin pignent passes through the shell and colors the interior a shade of blue just like the exterior.
</p>

<h2>WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF EGGSHELL SHADES?</h2>
<p>
While brown and white eggs may be the most popular in grocery stores, there are other egg colors that hens can lay, which include:
</p>
<b>White Egg</b><br>
<img src="images/chickens/white.jpg" alt="white chicken eggs" />
<p>White is the most popular eggshell color in America. One of the most well-known white eggs is thought to have been brought to America by Christopher Columbus. This popular egg is known as the Single-Comb White Leghorn. He is thought to have brought it to America in the year 1493. 
</p>

<b>Brownish Egg</b>
<br>
<img src="images/chickeneggs/brown_eggs.jpg" alt="brown chicken eggs" />
<p>
This is the second most popular eggshell color in America. As a matter of fact, New Englanders prefer brown eggs over the white ones. However, they aren't any different than white eggs when it comes down to nutrition and taste.

During the 3rd stage of the egg-laying process, a brownish pigment is transferred to the eggshell. This coloring isn't allowed to travel through the shell though so the inside remains white. Remember that all eggs start off as being white. 

Some brown eggs may have a shade of orange which is only due to shade intensity. The age, type, and the anxiety levels of a hen will impact the depth and tone of the egg's color. For example, a young 
hen might lay darker eggs than a hen that is more mature. </p>

<b>Blue</b><br>
<img src="images/chickeneggs/blue_eggs.jpg" alt="blue chicken eggs" />
<p>
What is a blue egg? This is not a Easter Egg creation! The blue colored eggshell is slowly becoming more popular nowadays. opposite to the process of creating a brown egg, a blue egg gets its color early 
in the egg-forming procedure. This means that when the pigment is allowed to reach the egg in the early stage, the inside of the egg also turns blue. A blue egg will also have blue throughout.
</p>

<h2>Why do we prefer brown or white eggs?</h2>
With all the different types of eggs available, why do a lot of us only eat white or brownish eggs? The reason is that white and brown eggs will more than likely cost less than blue eggs.
 White or brown eggs are much easier to get as well as normally originated from poultries that are known as
 good egg layers. And also, they have actually ended up being a part of our kitchen.

<h2>Where did chicken domestication originate?</h2>
<p>

Chickens have always been a very essential part of our existence. From humans in the ancient times, all the way to contemporary times, some chickens 
were used as sacred pets to some, while to others, they are an empty canvas for cooking. Their eggs are no no different.
It is almost impossible to the exact or precise begin date of egg usage, however some clues point to the domestication of the wild fowl in around the year 3200 B.C.
 Historians also came to the agreement that the fowls were eaten at a higher rate than their eggs, as the eggs were made used to hatch new birds.
  Chinese and Egyptian records show that these birds were laying eggs for human beings sometime around the year 1400 B.C.

<h2>Long time chicken farm owner Erika Wiggins explains on Quora</h2>
<b>Why chickens lay different color eggs</b>
<div class="notepaper">
    <figure class="quote">
      <blockquote class="curly-quotes" cite="https://www.quora.com/Why-are-chicken-eggs-different-colors">
        The simple answer is genetics. There are a lot of different colors of eggs in the world, such as a robin's-egg-blue and darkly speckled quail eggs.

        In chickens, there are two basic colors of egg shell: blue and white. In addition to the basic shell color, there a many genes for brown 
        coatings that are put on the egg by the bird as the egg is being laid. Blue is dominant over white, so a chicken with one gene for blue shells
         and one for white shells will lay blue eggs. Adding different brown coatings over these blue or white shells means that different breeds of chickens can lay many colors of eggs.
        
        This is highly simplified, but this is basically how chicken egg color genetics works:
        Blue shell genes, no coating genes: blue eggs
        White shell genes, no coating genes: white eggs
        One blue shell gene, one white shell gene, no coating genes: blue eggs
        Blue shell color + brown coating gene(s) = green eggs
        White shell color + brown coating gene(s) = brown eggs
        
        Since breeds of any kind are basically human genetic engineering over time, humans have fixed egg color and coating genes 
        in different breeds of chickens. Ameraucanas and Araucanas must lay a blue egg, or they are not those breeds. Marans must lay an 
        egg with at least a certain darkness of brown shell, or they are not Marans. Leghorns must lay a white egg. Etc. Etc. Cross-bred chickens such as the
         Easter Egger will have lots of variability of egg color between individuals, laying brown, green, blue, cream, or even a pinkish egg. It's all genetics.

    <h2>WHAT BREEDS OF CHICKENS LAY BLUE EGGS?</h2>

These chickens are typically only bred for the objective of marketing the phenomenal and pricey eggs. 
These eggs sell for a premium due to their elegance but additionally because these chickens do not generate the volume of eggs that regular chickens do.

<h3>Araucana</h3>
The Araucana is a type of chicken that is.native to north Chile, They were initially bred by the Arauca Indians. This chicken has no tail, which in the poultry world is known as being "rumpless".

 there is a major difference in that the Ameraucana does have a tail. There are 8 different color variations for this bird. 
You can also find them in miniature form which people have been turning into pets more often recently. 
These miniature Ameraucana chickens are known as bantam.

<h3>Easter Eggers</h3>
<p>
Easter Eggers are not an actual type of chicken. Their name comes only from their 
capability to create colored eggs, which consists of blue. An Easter Egger chicken might come
 from the Araucana or Ameraucana supply chain, however does not satisfy the criteria to be labelled as one of those breeds. A hen of any type of breed that mates with a 
 Araucana or Ameraucana will create offspring that will certainly lay blue eggs.
</p>
<h4>What's an Americana Chicken?</h4>
<p>
Technically speaking, there is no type of chicken known as an "Americana". The punctuation of the name Americana is a derivation of the americauna breed.

                                                    <p>Pets are at times our best friends. We should all take care of them with everything we have. They depend on us for food 
                                                        and shelter and they in turn give us their love and attention. We love our dog Sage and could never see ourselves living without her.</p>
