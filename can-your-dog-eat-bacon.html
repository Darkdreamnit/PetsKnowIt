If your dog ate raw bacon, try to find out how much him/her ate. If you found out that the amound of raw bacon that your dog ate is miniscule, then just let the bacon run its coarse. Otherwise, bring your dog to the veterinarian and let him/her know your dog ate a good portion of bacon.

                                                    The same risks that apply to cooked bacon also apply to raw bacon. Except, raw bacon has the potential of introducing other foreign elements into your pet that would have been killed
                                                    during the cooking process. One such element is the possibility of worms. And do not be surprised if they get Salmonella poisoned.

                                                        Diarrhea will happen in your pet if they do not get the right balance in their diet. It is always a plus to know how to combat certain types of illnesses in your pets before they arise. Diarrhea is not a disease, 
                                                        it is simply a condition that happens when the body tries to get rid of bad food or certain types of pathogens before they are absorbed by the body.

                                                        This type of diarrhea can be treated easily at home by just putting your dog on a 24-HR rice-water diet. Be sure to use only white rice as it contains the necessary active probiotic cultures. Brown rice will not suffice. After putting your dog n the 24-HR rice-water diet, it would be best to put him/her on a short fast as this will allow the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) to rest.

Probiotics are good bacteria that are good for your digestive system. But where do we find probiotics? Probiotics can be found in foods and snacks such as yogurt, dark chocolate, some types of cheese, leafy greens and dandelion greens, onions, and many others. <u>Yogurt and lettuce are the only ones on this list that is recommended for your pet.</u> So one good treat to feed after your dog or dogs eat bacon is yogurt. It is a tasty treat while also helping the digestive system.

                                                        <p>Pets are at times our best friends. We should all take care of them with everything we have. They depend on us for food 
                                                            and shelter and they in turn give us their love and attention. We love our dog Sage and could never see ourselves living without her.</p>
