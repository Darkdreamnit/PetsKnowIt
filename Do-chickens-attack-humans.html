                                                    complicated. When chickens attack humans, there might be many different scratches, some of which can be very nasty. There might also be the possible chance of damage to the eyes even though that

                                                    <p>
                                                        Chickens are not known to be predatory animals, and they are known to mostly get along quite fine with humans on a whole. Some chicken 
                                                        owners have even stated that they get genuine love and affection from their pet chicken. 
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        However, one should note that these animals are not completely passive, they have been known to attack humans. Roosters are more likely to attack as they are the ones who are tasked with protecting other members of their flock from 
                                                        intruders. This means that if any chickens should attack, it would more likely be a rooster.
                                                    </p>

                                                           This is really difficult for me to relive. But for the sake of others and in the hope of preventing anyone else from experiencing this horror, I know I must tell my story.
                                                      
                                                      On this eventful day, it started out like any other saturday. Clear blue skies, birds singing and the wonderful feeling from knowing that I had the luxury of a whole day of nothingness to enjoy. I was happy, unaware of the horror that was to unfold.
                                                      
                                                      I decided to check on our pet chickens, Jack, Jill, Jack junior and little Jill. I should have suspected something was up, I had noticed them spending more and more time together. Heads together, pecking together and eating together. On this particular day, they had each looked up to eyeball me with their beady eyes as I entered their pen. Their territory. They looked as evil as chickens can possibly look evil.
                                                      
                                                      
                                                      But I didn't think much of it. Thought it was cute actually. So I carried on cleaning out their pen and refilling their water. As soon as I turned my back and had squatted to reach their water bowl, the loud wing flapping began. I looked around in alarm as Jack and Jill climbed up a hill to attack my face. I fell over backwards and that is when the rest of the family joined in on the pecking frenzy. I swung around wildly with no success so I cried out for help. As if on cue, the evil chickens quickly waddled out the pen into the open and into freedom. That is my last memory of them, their chicken butts waddling quickly as if to mock me while I lay on my back helpless.
                                                      
                                                      Ok so maybe that's not really happened but if I had to part with any advice it would be to never step on a chicken because they will peck you in self defense and if you are unlucky, their friends will join in too.

       Chickens that are scared will try to hide or run away.

Some people think chickens don't get sad, but they do, especially if they don't have enough room 
to perform normal chicken behaviors like scratching and so forth,
because their instincts are frustrated. This renders them helpless to do the things they need to! When
they are sad, often let out very sad sounds that are unmistakable, the same way your dog might whimper if
he is unhappy because he is hungry or needs to go outside.

When I lost my favorite hen to a predator, her sister cried sad sounds for several days, and looked for her
in all her favorite spots. When she realized Lily was not coming back, she followed me around for days wanting 
lots of petting and attention. She was lonely! When my rooster was injured, I kept him inside to recover, and his
favorite ladies would all wait right outside the sliding glass door to be as near him as possible.
They missed him in their chicken-y way, and I had to carry them all into the coop every night after dark, 
because they wouldn't go in without him. Once he came back outside, they all went in every night on their own like clockwork, just as before.

If you watch your chickens closely, after a while you will be able to learn their body language and know 
when they are happy, sad, broody, ill, scared, mad or something different entirely.

                                                            and whosoever is the most dominant will eat first.

                                                            chicken's pecking order is very important as it creates a system within the flock. To differentiate between a chicken's pecking order system or just plain aggression, just know that a pecking order fight will bve over 
                                                            quickly while aggression within the flock will be ongoing.

                                                        <p>Hens understand when their babies or other chickens around are in discomfort. They display anxiety and stress when near other chickens experiencing any type of distress.</p>

<p>When a chicken has been rid of from its flock, her character begins to emerge. Chickens most typically reveal love by following their human companion around fanatically. Feeding them by placing food in your hand will definitely seal the bond in between chicken and human.</p>

Chickens are rather smart. If you have any type of chicken, you might have seen how they see everything and everybody.</p>
<p>
Chicks, while establishing inside their eggs, will get both affection and love from Mommy Hen. When a hen's babies hatch, mommy hen will keep a close eye on them. Keeping them safe and free from harm.</p>

                                                <P>Do chickens attack hums? Yes, they do at times. But roosters are the main culprit till you show them that you are dominant. Being attacked by a chicken 
                                                    is not as dangerous as it might seem unless they somehow attack you in the face.
